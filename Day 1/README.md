# Day 01 â€“ Hello World, User Input & Personalized Messages

Welcome to **Day 01** of my [100 Days of Python] challenge!  
This was my first day warming up with Python, starting with the classic "Hello World" and ending with a personalized greeting generator. It's all about getting comfortable with the basics and building good habits early.

## What I Learned

### Basics
- Printing messages to the console using `print()`
- Declaring variables like `name` and `hobby`
- Taking user input using `input()`
- Using **f-strings** for cleaner, readable output

---

## What I Built

A simple **Welcome Message Generator** that:
- Greets the user
- Asks for their name and favorite hobby
- Delivers a personalized message

## Sample Output

```text
What's your name? Sam
What's your favorite hobby? Reading

--- Welcome Message ---
