# Day 03 – Arithmetic Operations & Simple Calculator

Today I explored **arithmetic operations** and built a basic **calculator** in Python. This was all about getting comfortable with math in code — something we’ll need constantly.

---

## What I Learned

- Integer & float operations
- Type conversion (string ↔ int)
- Formatted output with f-strings
- Building a basic calculator that does:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (with error handling for zero)

---

## Features Built

- A greeting that asks for your name
- Doubling a number using string multiplication
- Performing arithmetic on two user-input numbers
- Displaying:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Floor Division
  - Modulus
  - Exponentiation
- Simple calculator using two `float` inputs

---

## Sample Output
  Enter the first number: 5
  Enter the second number: 3

  --- Calculator Results ----
  Addition:5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0
  Subtraction:5.0 - 3.0 = 2.0
  Multiplication:5.0 x 3.0 = 15.0
  Division:5.0 / 3.0 = 1.6666666667
