# üêç Day 02 ‚Äì Variables, Data Types & Personalized Greetings

Welcome to **Day 02** of my [100 Days of Python] challenge!

Today I took a deeper dive into the *core concepts* of Python ‚Äî the building blocks like variables, data types, user input, type conversion, and string formatting.  
It may seem basic, but this is the DNA of all great code.

## What I Learned

### Variables
- Assigned values to variables like `name`, `age`, `height`, and `is_student`

### Data Types
- `str` ‚Äì Strings for names and text
- `int` ‚Äì Whole numbers
- `float` ‚Äì Decimal values
- `bool` ‚Äì True/False values

### Type Conversion
- Converted strings to integers using `int()`

### String Formatting
- Practiced all 3 ways:
  - Concatenation ‚Üí `"Hello, " + name`
  - `.format()` method ‚Üí `"Hello, {}!".format(name)`
  - f-strings ‚Üí `f"Hello, {name}!"`

### User Input
- Used `input()` to ask the user for:
  - Their name
  - Age
  - Favorite color

## What I Built

A fun little **personalized greeting program**  
The script collects the user's name, age, and favorite color, then prints a friendly message with that data.

### Sample Output

```text
What is your name? Sam
How old are you? 19
What is your favorite color? Blue

---- Personalized Greeting ----
Hello, Sam!
You are 19 years old and Blue is a beautiful color!
Heck Yeah!
