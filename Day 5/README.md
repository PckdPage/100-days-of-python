# Day 05 – Loops & Countdown Timer

Today was all about **loops** — one of the most powerful tools in programming. I used both `for` and `while` loops and even played around with `time.sleep()` to add delays.

## What I Learned

- `for` loops with custom ranges
- `while` loops for countdowns
- Using the `time` module to slow down output

---

## What I Built

- A reverse countdown using a `for` loop from 10 to 1
- A **custom countdown timer** that:
  - Asks the user where to start
  - Counts down with a 1-second pause
  - Ends with a completion message

---

## Sample Output
Enter the number to start the countdown from: 5

Starting Countdown
5
4
3
2
1
Countdown Complete!
